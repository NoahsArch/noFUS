# Debian 13 OpenVPN Auto-Connect Fix
This configuration ensures your OpenVPN connection in NetworkManager starts automatically on boot or when connected to specific networks, without asking for a password or showing a confirmation popup.

## Setup and Dependencies
Install the required packages and open the NetworkManager connection editor to create or import your .ovpn configuration:
sudo apt-get install network-manager-openvpn-gnome
nm-connection-editor
nmcli connection show

Use the editor to import your VPN profile, then verify the connection name using the nmcli command above. Once the connection exists, continue below.

nmcli connection show

## Changes Made
Open the VPN configuration file:
sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/<your-vpn>.nmconnection

Inside [vpn], ensure this line exists or is changed to:
[vpn]
password-flags=0        # store the password in this file (no prompt)

Inside [connection], add or modify these lines:
[connection]
autoconnect=true         # enable auto-connect on boot or when network is active
autoconnect-retries=0    # keep retrying if disconnected (optional)

Save the file and set proper permissions if needed:
sudo chown root:root /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/Ovpn.nmconnection
sudo chmod 600 /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/Ovpn.nmconnection

## Commands Run
Reload and restart NetworkManager so changes take effect:
sudo nmcli connection reload
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager

Verify the settings:
nmcli connection show "Ovpn" | grep -E 'autoconnect|password-flags'

Expected output:
connection.autoconnect: yes
vpn.password-flags: 0

Test the connection manually (optional):
nmcli connection up "Ovpn"

If it connects without prompting, your auto-connect setup is complete.

## Notes
- network-manager-openvpn-gnome provides the GUI and VPN plugin required by nm-connection-editor.
- password-flags=0 tells NetworkManager to use the stored password instead of prompting.
- autoconnect=true ensures the VPN automatically activates when your system connects to a matching network or starts up.
- Works reliably on Debian 13, Kali, and other pure NetworkManager-based systems (without Netplan or Canonical patches).

Tested on Framework 13 (Ryzen 7040) running Debian 13 GNOME Wayland.
